# PythonLearning

just start learning a beautiful language today -->Python<br>
Why? because it's fun and powerful with those frameworks, I wanna use it with JS to build web apps<br>
feel the best way to start is trying code with it, may take few days to get familiar with the syndex....
Python >= Java!
