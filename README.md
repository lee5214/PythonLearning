# PythonLearning

Just start learning a beautiful language today -->Python<br>
Why? because it's fun and powerful with those frameworks and libraries, I wanna use it together with JS and XXX to build web apps<br>
Feel the best way to start is trying code with it, may take few days to get familiar with the syndex....
Python >= Java!
